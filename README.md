## Description:
This program is written in three modes without the help of a special library, which can be developed in all three modes
## Instructions:
1.Simulate your repository:`git clone https://github.com/MaryaJamali/TextAnalysis-with-Python.git`
<br>
2. Place two `output textanalysis.csv` & `read textanalysis.txt` files next to the project
<br>
<br>

3.If you run `Functional Program.py` , enter your text manually and the program will display the information in a dictionary after removing the stopwords and punctuation marks. The key of the dictionary is the main words and its value is the number of repeated words.This program does not depend on `output textanalysis.csv` & `read text analysis.txt` two files.
<br>
<br>

4.If you run `FunctionalProgram with File.py` , first modify the file addressing in codes 4 and 48, put the desired text in the `read text analysis.txt` file, after running the program and after removing the stopwords and punctuation marks. It displays the information in a folder named `output textanalysis.csv`. If the file is created, the information is displayed in it, and if it is not created, the program itself creates the file named `output textanalysis.csv' and displays the information.
<br>
<br>

5.If you run `ObjectOrientedProgram.py` , enter your text manually, and after removing stopwords and punctuation marks, the program will display stopwords and punctuations in two separate lists and display the main words in a dictionary, where the dictionary key is the main words and its value is the number of repetitions.This program does not depend on the two files `output textanalysis.csv` & `read textanalysis.txt`
